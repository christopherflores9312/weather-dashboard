## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the web page.
- `assets/css/style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the web page.
- `assets/js/script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching and displaying weather data, as well as handling user interactions.
